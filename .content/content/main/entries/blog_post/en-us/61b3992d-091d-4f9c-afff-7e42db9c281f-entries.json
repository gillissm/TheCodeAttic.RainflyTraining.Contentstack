The first wagons, belonging to the Donner-Reed Party, crossed this divide in 1846, followed in 1847 by Brigham Young's vanguard party of Mormon pioneers. Imagine those emigrants' despair upon reaching this spot and seeing the jagged, blue-gray peaks of the Wasatch Mountains on the horizon ahead. From here, both wagon companies had to grub a rough track over divides and mountains and down a series of willow-packed canyons and creek bottoms in order to reach the Valley of the Great Salt Lake.Â The effort cost the Donner-Reed party 13 days, one of a series of troubles that caused the group to be trapped by blizzards in the Sierra Nevada Mountains"}]}],"_version":1},"featured_image":{"uid":"blta9d06c6bbced509a","created_at":"2025-02-05T16:15:08.182Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T16:15:08.182Z","created_by":"cs6570221eb30a96cc","updated_by":"cs6570221eb30a96cc","content_type":"image/webp","file_size":"54876","tags":[],"filename":"history3_1.webp","url":"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt007136d3bb9fec54/blta9d06c6bbced509a/67a38e8c960716f134994ba7/history3_1.webp","ACL":[],"is_dir":false,"parent_uid":"blte8f5e90fdf1a5291","_version":1,"title":"history3_1.webp","publish_details":[{"environment":"blt54a77ceb5fbf5e6d","locale":"en-us","time":"2025-02-05T16:15:39.161Z","user":"cs6570221eb30a96cc","version":1}]}},"author":{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"Johnson","based_out_of":[{"uid":"blt2f360c5cbfc2d4d4","_content_type_uid":"location"}],"profile_image":null,"profile_url":{"title":"","href":""}},"taxonomies":[{"taxonomy_uid":"activity","term_uid":"hike"},{"taxonomy_uid":"activity","term_uid":"climb"},{"taxonomy_uid":"activity","term_uid":"camp"}],"tags":[],"locale":"en-us","uid":"blt6fd22127d6a095cc","ACL":{},"_version":1,"_in_progress":false,"publish_details":[{"environment":"blt54a77ceb5fbf5e6d","locale":"en-us","time":"2025-02-05T16:32:15.677Z","user":"cs6570221eb30a96cc","version":1}]}}
