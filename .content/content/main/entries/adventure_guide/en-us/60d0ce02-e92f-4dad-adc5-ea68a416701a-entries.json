Hand-raised goats are polite, inquisitive, sure-footed, and willing companions, capable of carrying 25-30% of their body weight, approximately 30-65 pounds.  You may meet our older, retired pack goats.  We can no longer backpack, nor can the old guys, but Lanita and Suzanne hiked hundreds of miles with these sweet and willing companions carrying our camp and provisions. Today we all walk (unladen) around our land."}]}],"_version":2},"profile_pic":{"uid":"blt1d1137660fdec753","created_at":"2025-01-08T15:25:56.095Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T15:25:56.095Z","created_by":"cs6570221eb30a96cc","updated_by":"cs6570221eb30a96cc","content_type":"image/webp","file_size":"73790","tags":[],"filename":"GoatWithBackpack.webp","url":"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt007136d3bb9fec54/blt1d1137660fdec753/677e9904bf0f68f9a469d208/GoatWithBackpack.webp","ACL":[],"is_dir":false,"parent_uid":"blt9643445113b8f597","_version":1,"title":"GoatWithBackpack.webp","publish_details":[]},"top_trip_description":{"type":"doc","attrs":{},"uid":"dca0bc00eec94057a39eea165ba24342","children":[{"type":"p","attrs":{},"uid":"2aba3e3c2f4f42c9862e8e49e4db80ac","children":[{"text":"Pack goats are easy on trails and campsites, allowing your party to tread lightly on the land.
